## Practice


## Projects
* European languagd detector
* Inspire_HEP
* MNIST
  * Use only 5000 records to build models for MNIST
  * Use different models
     * Non-linear SVM, linear SVM
     * Logistic regression
     * Decision tree
     * Ada Boost, Bagging, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest
     * kNN, Bagged kNN
     * Naive Bayes
     * Neural network
  * Use gray scale and black-and-white to build models and check the model performances.
* MusicBox
  * See [Musicbox\_README.md](Musicbox/Musicbox_README.md) for more details.
  * Scrap data from online music streaming platform.
  * Analyze three types of log files including users' search, download, and play records from 2017/03/01 to 2017/05/12.
     * Here is the list of [data](https://bittigermusicplayerdata.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/list.html)
  * Use Spark to analyze user behavior patterns and trends.
     * Perform feature engineering using PySpark.
  * Use Sci-kit learn and Spark to predict churn rate of users.
* Uber\_rider\_churn\_prediction
  * See [Uber_README.md](Uber_rider_churn_prediction/Uber_README.md) for more details.
  * Apply data cleaning and exploratory data analysis to select the useful features for building models.
  * Load the cleaned data and build different models to see the performances for different models.
  * Use models:
     * Logistic regression
     * Single decision tree
     * Bagged trees
     * Single kNN
     * Bagged kNN
     * Random forest
     * Gradient boosting trees
     * Neural network
     * Linear SVM
     * Non-linear SVM
  * Apply grid search on the random forest model to find the best hyperparameters.
